        <p>Hello, My name is Brandon Serna and I am originally from mexico. I moved up to Oklahoma when I was 7 years old I was living in Tulsa till 2021. I moved down to Oklahoma city
            in late 2021 and lived there till 2024. In late 2024 my fiance took a travel nursing position and we relocated to Burlington, Vermont. Not sure where we are headed

            <p>Oklahoma is a state in the center of the United States. The two major cities in oklahoma are Tulsa and Oklahoma City which is home to the recent 2025 NBA Champions The Oklahoma city Thunder.
                Great food scene that just keeps on developing in both cities. With the low cost of living the opportunities are endless.
